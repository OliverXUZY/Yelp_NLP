       " 'normally we get our daily/weekly gelato fix at \"frost\" or at \"that\\'s amore\" which is only a few miles from home. however my boyfriend and i happened to be in chandler today and instead of going to frost, we thought we\\'d try gelato 64. bad move. \\n\\ni normally do not post one-star reviews. in fact, if a business is that bad, i just don\\'t return. however in this case, since i love gelato and hate to have people experience bad gelato, consider this review a \"public service announcement\". \\n\\nat 3:30pm on monday, december 21, 2015 we walked in. no one in the front of the store. bad first impression. eventually an employee comes to the front of the store and i ask him \"why is one entire gelato freezer empty?\". he tells me that the freezer is broken. i ask \"how long has the freezer been broken?\" he replies \"over a week\". i then ask, \"so i guess this means you don\\'t have 48 flavors as advertised on your website?\" he agrees. 2nd bad impression. false advertising. they use to have 64 flavors, now they are down below 48 flavors ... very soon i guess they will have to rename it \"gelato ?\" as their gelato selections keep plummeting. lol\\n\\nanyway, i ask to taste a few flavors and can\\'t seem to taste much flavor in anything but i eventually settle on a triple cone: mud pie chocolate, chocolate-banana, and wild berry. my boyfriend is easy, vanilla. \\n\\nhis vanilla was totally tasteless. my flavors were okay but if comparing them to frost or that\\'s amore, then there is no comparison! \\n\\nthe reason for my one-star review is coming up, so please read on. when we get into our car and start eating we both noticed that our cones had large holes in the bottom. even though we grabbed two napkins apiece, the thin napkins were not strong enough to stop the ice cream from leaking onto my italian leather coat. (ironically purchased in rome, italy) my boyfriend got vanilla ice cream on his jeans (no big deal) but try getting chocolate ice cream out of leather! i guess i will have a permanent reminder of this experience. but it gets worse...\\n\\nin the middle of eating my chocolate-banana scoop i notice a green & yellow worm (i\\'ve included a photo of my \"holy\" cone and the worm). i\\'m sure this worm was meant for perhaps another flavor, i didn\\'t eat it, but i\\'m guessing it was a candy worm? anyway, it just totally freaked me out seeing a worm in the middle of my cone. so between the \"holy\" leaking cones, the worm and the stain on my italian leather coat, i\\'m giving gelato 64 one star. \\n\\nif you love gelato, go to frost, their cones don\\'t come with holes! they actually come with protective paper sleeves. i love the authentic flavor at frost and when frost serves you a sample it is a very generous spoonful. also, i must add that gelato 64 advertises wafer cones. the employee who waited on us told me that they have never had wafer cones ... so again, there is alot of false advertising happening at gelato 64. buyer beware!',\n",

       " 'so i\\'ve been meaning to write a review for this place for a long time and while i waited, my rating of this place has gone down to 1-star from a former would-be 5-star. so this is a final review, as i won\\'t be coming back again.\\n\\nthe food\\n\\nthis being a gelato place, the criteria are simple: good choice of flavors and have gelato taste like gelato. \\n\\ni\\'ve been coming to this place for about 3 years and the variety has been dwindling overtime, taking a major hit in the past 6 months. there are now a good third less choices than there were initially. the fruit/berry flavors took the main hit and there are now very few pure flavors left, the rest are some sort of \"mixes\". the pear flavor i loved is long gone. one of the formerly gelato displays now houses ice cream cakes. i imagine they have a good profit margin, but may be the place should rename itself into gelato-ish 32.\\n\\nfine, selection has to cater to the customer base and there\\'s little that can be done about poor and unimaginative tasting pallet of other regulars. but that\\'s not an excuse for having stale waffle cones that lack any sort of crunchiness. my last waffle cone actually required some deliberate chewing and had the distinct left-too-long-in-the-back-of-the-cupboard aftertaste.\\n\\nas for the gelato itself, i could, of course, point to my street cred of having eaten gelato in italy and it being much better, but there\\'s no need for that. i\\'ve eaten much better gelato at this store not all that long ago. this appears to be nothing more than glorified, sometimes freezer burned, ice cream.\\n\\nanother thing that detracts from the gelato is the large amount of drying/dying fruits and berries put on top of each of the flavors for \"display\" purposes. not appetizing in anyway whatsoever.\\n\\nsetting\\n\\nnothing has changed in this regard, thankfully. the place is easy to get to and you have a choice of sitting inside or out. the displays are conveniently placed and moving around is not a problem. bathrooms are clean.\\n\\nservice\\n\\nanother area where this store has gone downhill. getting a sample now is like watching nano-technological exhibition where the server-bot takes off the tiniest sliver of gelato possible so you have a chance at (maybe) figuring out its taste. the scooping is inconsistent as well, which is pretty impressive considering that ice cream scoops by nature are a consistent measuring tool .\\n\\nother\\n\\nthe frequent \"eater\" cards have disappeared with the new owners, so there is one less reason to come back here. they do seem to have wifi now, which should help you log online and find a different gelato place to go to.',\n",

       " 'well, i\\'ve been using yelp to guide me to the best places to satisfy my food porn needs for over a year and a half now, so i might as well stop being lazy and actually give some input for once (said no one ever).\\n\\nanyhoooo, as a resident of the neighboring carré st. louis and a mcgill student, i frequently pass by this place on my way to class and the word on the street said that this is one of the best places for authentic mexican food in montréal. now, i find that a lot of the food scene in the city tends to lean toward the eurocentric side, and i\\'ve had bad experiences before with so-called \"mexican\" joints, both food- and service-wise, so i was a bit skeptical at first but willing to give it a try.\\n\\nwalking into the café, i was greeted with a whimsical vibe that made me instantly feel cozy and at home. splashes of color popped out at me in the form of paintings and the menu wall itself, but not in a totally jarring way that would distract one from the actual dining experience. i then proceeded to take a seat at the bar, with its wooden table and matching stools blending in nicely with everything else.\\n\\nafter scanning the menu once or twice, i proceeded to order the horchata, which is a staple whenever i go to a mexican place, and the tacos de cochinita (pulled pork tacos). the horchata\\'s flavor profile reminded me of not overly sweet cereal milk with warm tones at the end as a result of the cinnamon on top, providing an instant sort of satisfaction to the taste buds. afterwards, i waited awhile for the tacos to come out, but seeing as the only two people who were working at the time appeared to be the waiter/bartender and a single lady working in the kitchen, it was understandable. i\\'m not really the type of person to mind waiting in the first place as long as the food ends up tasting good, but if you\\'re the impatient type, you might want to take note.\\n\\nthe first bite of the taco in its natural form didn\\'t really wow me, as it tasted like the other pork tacos i\\'ve tried, but the second one really showcased the depth of the meat\\'s natural flavor, and the sauce seemed to enhance rather than overpower it. then, i decided to experiment with the condiments that were brought out on the side - fresh tomato salsa, pickled (i think?) onions, hot sauce, and lime wedges. now, normally i\\'m ambivalent to onions that aren\\'t explicitly in cooked form, as onions in their raw form overpower my tastebuds - and not in a pleasant way. but after trying the pickled onions on their own, i found the taste to be tangy and actually bearable for once, and the other condiments actually went along with the taco quite nicely and made it even more interesting. the hot sauce especially was very good - my requirements for a good hot sauce/oil are 1.) it has to actually be spicy and flavorful (trust me, i\\'ve had some where i would empty the whole bottle and it wouldn\\'t be spicy at all), and 2.) i shouldn\\'t have to use too much of it to feel that kick. it met both of the requirements, so you can say that i was a happy girl by the time i finished everything! *thumbs up*\\n\\noverall, it was a very tasty experience, and now i know where to go for my mexican food fix! they also do delivery if you download the foodora app, but normally you have to order a certain amount (from my experience normally the minimum is $15 worth of food), so it can get quite expensive especially if you\\'re on a student budget. therefore, it\\'s better to just walk here; the nearby park is very beautiful, plus you can grab an ice cream at its center while strolling and looking at the charming houses. the total price of my entire meal in-house was just over 12 cad including tax, so as an american, i was even more pleased when the exchange rate worked in my favor yet again mwahaha. i would definitely come back and order the huevos rancheros since it seems to be one of the main attractions! \\n\\n*side note* first review now in the books woohoo! let\\'s party!',\n",

       " \"when compared to other froyo places, menchie's is pretty average. there are about 10 flavors to choose from, and they make up for the lack of fresh fruit toppings by having many sauce options including marshmallow and the occasional uncommon topping like mochi. \\n\\nwhen compared to other sweet dessert options available in the downtown summerlin area though, menchie's is a hard sell and ranks pretty low on the list for me. indoor seating is very limited with a couple of hightops, but there are a few patio tables with umbrellas too. \\n\\nin a few visits though, the service is pretty consistently absent. i've walked in twice to no staff at all and spent the majority of my time making my order before someone came out to ring me up. i know staff are young and the shop doesn't get much traffic but once they realize customers are there, they often ring up and then retreat to the back again while customers are still present, which i find bizarre and irresponsible.\",\n",
       " \"menchie's is an average frozen yogurt place compared to others. there is a lack of fresh fruit toppings and more candy. the seating indoors is very limited. i've been here a couple of times, and the service seems to be absent. other that that, i love the dole whip they have. this is a good place in downtown summerlin if you're craving frozen yogurt.\",\n",
       " \"low carb nsa froyo @ 11 calories/oz?!?!? o-m-g!!! i am a froyo snob & never in my wildest dreams did i think a low carb nsa could be creamier & smoother than yogurtland!!! also love the fact that the toppings have lids on them. i just wish the chilled area did too. we work just down the street & never heard this was open!!! why so secret?!? i was even in the area when this location opened & it didn't even pop up on yelp. gotta make up for lost time now!! the dole lemon is so delish & is a great low calorie treat! it reminds me of a disney dole whip. the homemade waffle cones are bomb too! bonus: great customer service!!!!\",\n",

       " 'a great product but the service aspect really needs some leadership at this branch.  i stood in line for nearly 20 minutes tonight.  being only the second person in line i had to leave in frustration.  the teenagers working were only interested in talking amongst themselves.  the customer in front of me went around to the side and yelled to ask whether they were open.  that worked for them.  when the same thing happened to me, i had to give up.',\n",

       " 'i have previously given a rave review of kiwi loco.  we\\'ve come here several times during the week for their promotions, as listed on the website and on the front window of the shop. but  after nearly 3 months of regular visits, i\\'m redoing my yelp review.\\n\\ntoday, i took my kids in for the 1-3pm mom and tot special, where the 5oz kid cups are just $1.  \\n\\nfirst, the kids cups are not out, you have to ask for them.\\n\\nsecond, we got our 5 cups to the register and the young man behind the counter said my total was over $16.  so i said, \"aren\\'t the kid cups $1?\"  he looked confused, then said \"oh yeah\".  he gave me my new total of $8.29.  which still seemed high, but i thought maybe the children were $1 and mine was regular price.  so we sit down and i look closer at my receipt.  no, he put in a different discount and i was over charged.  so i took my receipt back up to him and explained that i was still overcharged.  a young girl came to the register to see what was going on.  the young man told her that i was asking for a discount that was only from 11a-1pm.  she and i both let him know that no, the promo was 1-3, as stated on the window.  she apologized for the error, and said that they couldn\\'t redo my transaction, she\\'d give me a $5 giftcard for my next purchase.  (it\\'s a digital giftcard on my loyalty acct, so i\\'m not even sure it will even appear since i have no physical proof of the giftcard).  i thanked her since the $5 was more than the wrongly charged amount, then rejoined my children at the table.\\n\\na few minutes later, the girl came to my table and said that \"in the future, you have to ask at the register for the promo, and had you done that, you wouldn\\'t have been overcharged.\"\\n\\nhold the phone.\\n\\ni\\'ve only ever come to the shop when they do the promos.  i\\'ve never had to ask for it.  if they are doing 20% off on mondays, or bogo on tuesdays or whatever, it just is, and we\\'ve never had to ask, they just do it.  so now, i have to remind them of their store promotion?  this isn\\'t a coupon you hand over, it\\'s a store wide promotion.  and she was saying it was my fault i was overcharged?  no.  i did tell the young man at the register when he gave me the incorrect total.  it was him who gave me the wrong discount, it was also him who tried to blame me for asking for an expired promotion, when the truth of the matter is that he doesn\\'t know his job properly.  it\\'s printed on the front door for heaven\\'s sake!\\n\\n ****update.  the owner returned me call and i explained all of this to him.  he did seem genuinely interested in the problem and apologized, said that he was very sorry for the issue and assured me that he would speak with his staff.  he said this particular promotion was one they were hoping to grow, so he was glad that i took the time to call and speak with him.  i was pleased with his prompt attention to my customer service call and i will give kiwi loco and their promos another shot***',\n",

       " \"back in the day when the tart frozen yogurt craze started with the wildly popular pinkberry, who knew that would lead to literally hundreds of knock offs. yes, even pinkberry is a knock off of the korean chain red mango, which is probably a knock off of another. but it was pinkberry's simple healthy approach, stylish interiors and lines out the door which drew much attention to itself and its concept. so it was only a matter of time before someone would copy the success, some almost as good and others well, not so much.\\n\\nyogurtland is one of those success stories, expanding to nearly 50 locations nationwide in only a few years. while it's not pinkberry, their claim to fame is to offer more for less. choose your size of cup then fill it with one of the many varieties of the low calorie, low sugar, non-fat fro-yo. then pile high the toppings ranging from fresh fruit, breakfast cereal, cookies, syrups and candy, be as stingy are as creative as you like. once your satisfied with your creation, set it on the scale for your total. yogurtland charges a mere $.30 an ounce so you can become quite the fro-yo artist with little investment to your imagination.\\n\\nonce it was my turn to approach the self service machines i was immediately overwhelmed by the choices. finally i got a hold of myself and made a fro-yo base of vanilla wafer cookies and cream, new york cheesecake and plain tart. though the best was yet to come, the topping station! bananas, vanilla wafers, fruity pebbles and chewy rainbow mochi, i was set and at $3.60 i felt like i somehow robbed them.\\n\\nbeing mostly a purist i immediately tapped the fruity pebble and banana adorned plain tart. for tart yogurt its bite was subtle, each bite was as delightful as the first. the vanilla wafer cookies and cream had an artificial vanilla taste which wasnt very good. however eating the new york cheesecake flavor was creamy and well rounded. the addition of the vanilla wafers was a hit and meshed really well with the smooth cheesecake taste.\\n\\nyogurtland is pretty hopping most nights, so take a dose of patients and imagine the endless choices that will be bestowed upon you once you reach the front of the line.\",\n",
